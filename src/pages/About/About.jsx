						<h2>InThisOrder was birthed from a need</h2>
						<p>
							As the Owner of The Kirk Concept and the Founder of
							InThisOrder. I am a full-time designer and
							passionate programmer who is adamant about creating
							things people truly enjoy. I have been happily
							married for 8 going on 87 years with two beautiful
							kids.
							<br />
							<br />
							What prompted me to create InThisOrder was my need
							to organize tasks for my daughter. When giving her a
							list of things to do, she does the first thing and
							comes back to ask what she is supposed to do next.
							She focuses on the task at hand and nothing else.
							InThisOrder helps kids focus on one task at a time.
							<br />
							<br /> The idea came to mind at the end of 2019 and
							because of Covid-19, 2020 has given me the time to
							finish version zero of the app. I look forward to
							seeing how InThisOrder helps others to organize
							tasks for their families. The goal is to continue to
							incorporate more fun and convenient features for
							families to enjoy. InThisOrder can only go up from
							here.
							<br />
							<br />
							In the meantime, shoot me an email with any
							questions at{' '}
							<a href="mailto:tkcwebdev@gmail.com">
								tkcwebdev@gmail.com
							</a>{' '}
							or connect with me on LinkedIn.
							<br />
							<br />
							<strong>Enjoy InThisOrder!</strong>
